# AMES Demo Website

This is a simple demo website for the AMES Club recruitment assignment. The project includes a login page and an events page built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** on the frontend and a **FastAPI** backend handling the logic and authentication.

## 🧠 Focus Areas

- The main focus of this project was backend development.
- I’ve implemented API routes using **FastAPI** for login functionality and time display.
- The backend is designed to connect with a shared database from my other FastAPI projects (though that part is excluded from this public repo for security reasons).

## 💻 Frontend

- The frontend includes a basic login page and an events page that displays upcoming events.
- I’ve used basic **HTML/CSS/JS**, and yes — I used **AI tools (like ChatGPT)** to guide and assist me in writing the frontend code.
- It’s intentionally kept simple and functional — not trying to over-polish something I’m still learning.

## 🔐 Security Note

- This repo excludes any sensitive files (like the database config) using `.gitignore`.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Version Control**: Git + GitHub

## 🚀 How to Run (Locally)

1. Clone the repo
2. Run the FastAPI backend (e.g. with `uvicorn`)
3. Open the `ames.html` file in a browser

I focused on understanding backend logic and clean API design while using AI to bridge gaps in my frontend experience.
